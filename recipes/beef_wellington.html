        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can beef broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons red wine</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 
            Place beef in a small baking dish, and spread with 
            2 tablespoons softened butter. Bake for 10 to 15 
            minutes, or until browned. Remove from pan, and allow 
            to cool completely. Reserve pan juices.
        </li>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium 
            heat. Saute onion and mushrooms in butter for 5 
            minutes. Remove from heat, and let cool.
        </li>
        <li>Mix together pate and 2 tablespoons butter, and 
            season with salt and pepper. Spread pate over beef. 
            Top with onion and mushroom mixture.
        </li>
        <li>Roll out the puff pastry dough, and place beef in 
            the center. Fold up, and seal all the edges, making sure 
            the seams are not too thick. Place beef in a 9x13 inch
            baking  dish, cut a few slits in the top of the dough, 
            and brush with egg yolk.
        </li>
        <li>Bake at 450 degrees F(230 degrees C) for 10 minutes,
            then reduce heat to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 
            10 to 15 more minutes, or until pastry is a rich, golden 
            brown. Set aside, and keep warm.
        </li>
        <li>Place all reserved juices in a small saucepan over 
            high heat. Stir in beef stock and red wine; boil for 
            10 to 15 minutes, or until slightly reduced. Strain, 
            and serve with beef.
        </li>
    </ol>
